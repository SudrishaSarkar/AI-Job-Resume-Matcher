# AI-Job-Resume-matcher
ResuMatch is a full-stack AI tool that analyzes a candidateâ€™s resume against a job description and generates a match score, alignment breakdown, and smart feedback. It goes beyond keyword matching by leveraging NLP and semantic similarity to identify strengths, gaps, and areas for improvement in resume bullets.

The system highlights missing or misaligned skills, quantifies match scores, and optionally provides GPT-powered rewrites to improve bullet points and boost alignment with job requirements.

This project targets job seekers who want actionable, explainable feedback on their resumes, not just vague scores or black-box suggestions.
